I have created a comprehensive guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, which includes my personal notes, exercises, and various resources that I have encountered at some point. It is focussed towards those that generally emphasize clarity of exposition over technical detail. It is mainly for my reference. 

## Topics covered include:
### 1. Basic Data Types

### 2. Trees

### 3. Basic Operations on Sets

### 4. Advanced Set Representation Methods

### 5. Sorting
  #### a) Insertion sort and Merge sort
  #### b) Heapsort 
  #### c) Quicksort
  #### d) Sorting in Linear Time
  #### e) Medians and Order Statistics
 
### 6. Algorithm Analysis Techniques

### 7. Algorithm Design Techniques

### 8. Graphs:
  #### a) Elementary Graph Algorithms
  #### b) Minimum Spanning Trees
  #### c) Single-Source Shortest Paths
  #### d) All-Pairs Shortest Paths
  #### e) Maximum Flow
  #### f) Matchings in Bipartite Graphs
