# DSA
I have created a comprehensive guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, which includes my personal notes, exercises, and various resources that I have encountered at some point. This guide focuses on providing clear explanations and understanding rather than excessive technical details. It serves as a reference for myself, encompassing the DSA concepts I have encountered throughout my learning journey.
